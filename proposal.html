                    <p>
                        Fantasy Football is a point-based game tied to the 
                        statistics of real-life football athlethes. You, the owner and manager of your 
                        fantasy football team, are in charge of the drafting and management of the team 
                        throughout the real-time season. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="subsection">What's the significance?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As this game is often played competitively, research 
                        prior to drafting and throughout the season is essential in improving your chances
                        to win. Your players' performance is a direct representation of their performance in 
                        games played and to help with the draft selection or waiver wire pick up, some form of 
                        accessible stat tracker would assist in your decision making. 
                        In this statistics based game, having access to these statistics would allow 
                        the player to make better educated predictions on who may perform well - it 
                        may also enrich their experience as they get to know players more.
                        Currently, there are a few fantasy football stat tracking aides, however, 
                        they generally are behind paywalls and are not as user-friendly. I believe 
                        there is room for improvement in this niche - there is room to improve the 
                        fantasy football experience. Creating a simple stat tracker allows enthusiasts and 
                        casual players to learn more of a player they intend to draft/pick up from waivers.

                <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            With a couple years of experience in being an active member of the fantasy football community, I believe 
                            an application or webpage that consolidates and displays information of players would be beneficial for a 
                            quick-glance type of resource. By creating an info-summary of players based on their past season, fantasy football 
                            managers can quickly access the performance of a certain player and gleam some insight from their statistics. There are 
                            a couple resources that attempt to do this, for example - FantasyPros, but they are often behind a paywall and typically 
                            not beginner friendly.

                            I will be drawing from a dataset that provides the relevant statistics for fantasy football. Using this data, I intend to
                            allow users to display player stat summaries by position - this should a allow for more specificity in filtering through 
                            player data.
